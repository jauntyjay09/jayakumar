        <u>Markus Zusak</u>, author of <u>The Book Thief</u>,
         was inspired by an eye-witness account his mother had told him when 
         he was growing up: as Jews were being marched down the street by Nazis, 
         a boy offered a struggling old man a piece of bread. In response,
          the German soldiers took away the bread and whipped the man and the boy.
           Zusak saw this as the <b><i>ultimate</i></b> symbol of the difference between
            kindness and cruelty,
         and it became a repeating theme in his novel.

                <p>Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock.
                        They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.
                         An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.
                   
                 In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc.
                           Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. 
                           Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.
